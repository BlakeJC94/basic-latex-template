abstract = {Neuronal activity in the brain gives rise to transmembrane currents that can be measured in the extracellular medium. Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources--including Na(+) and Ca(2+) spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations--can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

Metamorphosis between these forms occurred in about 1/3 of seizures beginning with either form alone. A wave form change occurred in 44{\%} of clinical attacks but only 7{\%} of subclinical seizures. Spikes and sharp waves were the most common repetitive epileptiform potentials encountered. Repitition rate of phenomena at onset usually lay in the theta or delta range except for a few with high frequency sinusoidal waves. Further ictal EEG progression was more likely to occur if a mixed frequency change or frequency increase characterised early evolution. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explain critical features of the human primary generalized epilepsies by investigating the dynamical bifur-cations of a nonlinear model of the brain's mean field dynamics. The model treats the cortex as a medium for the propagation of waves of electrical activity, incorporating key physiological processes such as propagation delays, membrane physiology, and corticothalamic feedback. Previous analyses have demonstrated its descriptive validity in a wide range of healthy states and yielded specific pre-dictions with regards to seizure phenomena. We show that mapping the structure of the nonlinear bifurcation set predicts a number of crucial dynamic processes, including the onset of periodic and chaotic dynamics as well as multistability. Quantitative study of electrophysiological data supports the validity of these predictions. Hence, we argue that the core electrophysiological and cognitive differences between tonic--clonic and absence seizures are pre-dicted and interrelated by the global bifurcation diagram of the model's dynamics. The present study is the first to present a unifying explanation of these generalized seizures using the bifurcation analysis of a dynamical model of the brain.},

New modes of inheritance for alterations of genes encoding transcription factors have also been described. Finally, actors known to be involved in a very specific phenotype (hypogonadotroph hypogonadism for instance) have been identified in a wider range of phenotypes. These data thus suggest that new mechanisms could explain the low rate of etiological identification in this heterogeneous group of diseases.

abstract = {We focus on the implications that the underlying neuronal dynamics might have on the possibility of anticipating seizures and designing an effective paradigm for their control. Transitions into seizures can be caused by parameter changes in the dynamic state or by interstate transitions as occur in multi-attractor systems; in the latter case, only a weak statistical prognosis of the seizure risk can be achieved. Nevertheless, we claim that by applying a suitable perturbation to the system, such as electrical stimulation, relevant features of the system's state may be detected and the risk of an impending seizure estimated. Furthermore, if these features are detected early, transitions into seizures may be blocked. On the basis of generic and realistic computer models we explore the concept of acute seizure control through state-dependent feedback stimulation. We show that in some classes of dynamic transitions, this can be achieved with a relatively limited amount of stimulation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Cook2013,
abstract = {Background: Seizure prediction would be clinically useful in patients with epilepsy and could improve safety, increase independence, and allow acute treatment. We did a multicentre clinical feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of a long-term implanted seizure advisory system designed to predict seizure likelihood and quantify seizures in adults with drug-resistant focal seizures. Methods: We enrolled patients at three centres in Melbourne, Australia, between March 24, 2010, and June 21, 2011. Eligible patients had between two and 12 disabling partial-onset seizures per month, a lateralised epileptogenic zone, and no history of psychogenic seizures. After devices were surgically implanted, patients entered a data collection phase, during which an algorithm for identification of periods of high, moderate, and low seizure likelihood was established. If the algorithm met performance criteria (ie, sensitivity of high-likelihood warnings greater than 65{\%} and performance better than expected through chance prediction of randomly occurring events), patients then entered an advisory phase and received information about seizure likelihood. The primary endpoint was the number of device-related adverse events at 4 months after implantation. Our secondary endpoints were algorithm performance at the end of the data collection phase, clinical effectiveness (measures of anxiety, depression, seizure severity, and quality of life) 4 months after iniation of the advisory phase, and longer-term adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01043406. Findings: We implanted 15 patients with the advisory system. 11 device-related adverse events were noted within four months of implantation, two of which were serious (device migration, seroma); an additional two serious adverse events occurred during the first year after implantation (device-related infection, device site reaction), but were resolved without further complication. The device met enabling criteria in 11 patients upon completion of the data collection phase, with high likelihood performance estimate sensitivities ranging from 65{\%} to 100{\%}. Three patients' algorithms did not meet performance criteria and one patient required device removal because of an adverse event before sufficient training data were acquired. We detected no significant changes in clinical effectiveness measures between baseline and 4 months after implantation. Interpretation: This study showed that intracranial electroencephalographic monitoring is feasible in ambulatory patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. If these findings are replicated in larger, longer studies, accurate definition of preictal electrical activity might improve understanding of seizure generation and eventually lead to new management strategies.

abstract = {Epilepsy is a network phenomenon characterized by atypical activity during seizure both at the level of single neurons and neural populations. The etiology of epilepsy is not completely understood but a common theme among proposed mechanisms is abnormal synchronization between neuronal populations. Recent advances in novel imaging and recording technologies have enabled the inference of comprehensive maps of both the anatomical and physiological inter-relationships between brain regions. Clinical protocols established for diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy utilize both advanced neuroimaging techniques and neurophysiological data. These growing clinical datasets can be further exploited to better understand the complex connectivity patterns in the epileptic brain. In this article, we review results and insights gained from the growing body of research focused on epilepsy from a network perspective. In particular, we put an emphasis on two different notions of network connectivity: functional and effective; and studies investigating these notions in epilepsy are highlighted. We also discuss limitations and opportunities in data collection and analyses that will further our understanding of epileptic networks and the mechanisms of seizures.},

We determine a quasi-analytic formula for the exit time problem for our model in the presence of noise. This formula--which we equate to seizure frequency--is then validated numerically, before we extend our study to explore the combined effects of noise and network structure on escape times. Here, we observe that weakly connected networks of 2, 3 and 4 nodes with equivalent first transitive components all have the same asymptotic escape times. We finally extend this work to larger networks, inferred from electroencephalographic recordings from 35 patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsies and 40 controls. Here, we find that network structure in patients correlates with smaller escape times relative to network structures from controls. These initial findings are suggestive that network structure may play an important role in seizure initiation and seizure frequency.},

abstract = {Surgery is a valuable option for pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. However, significant post-operative improvements are not always attained. This is due in part to our incomplete understanding of the seizure generating (ictogenic) capabilities of brain networks. Here we introduce an in silico, model-based framework to study the effects of surgery within ictogenic brain networks. We find that factors conventionally determining the region of tissue to resect, such as the location of focal brain lesions or the presence of epileptiform rhythms, do not necessarily predict the best resection strategy. We validate our framework by analysing electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings from patients who have undergone epilepsy surgery. We find that when post-operative outcome is good, model predictions for optimal strategies align better with the actual surgery undertaken than when post-operative outcome is poor. Crucially, this allows the prediction of optimal surgical strategies and the provision of quantitative prognoses for patients undergoing epilepsy surgery.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on high-frequency (gamma band) EEG activity, the most characteristic electrophysiological pattern in focal seizures of human epilepsy. It starts with recent hypotheses about: (i) the behaviour of inhibitory interneurons in hippocampal or neocortical networks in the generation of gamma frequency oscillations; (ii) the nonuniform alteration of GABAergic inhibition in experimental epilepsy (reduced dendritic inhibition and increased somatic inhibition); and (iii) the possible depression of GABA(A,fast) circuit activity by GABA(A,slow) inhibitory postsynaptic currents. In particular, these hypotheses are introduced in a new computational macroscopic model of EEG activity that includes a physiologically relevant fast inhibitory feedback loop. Results show that strikingly realistic activity is produced by the model when compared to real EEG signals recorded with intracerebral electrodes. They show that, in the model, the transition from interictal to fast ictal activity is explained by the impairment of dendritic inhibition.},

abstract = {Abstract Locomotor performance can influence the ecological and evolutionary success of a species. For fish, favorable outcomes of predator-prey encounters are often presumably due to robust acceleration ability. Although escape-response or "fast-start" studies utilizing high-speed cinematography are prevalent, little is known about the contribution of relative acceleration performance to ecological or evolutionary success in a species. This dearth of knowledge may be due to the time-consuming nature of analyzing film, which imposes a practical limit on sample sizes. Herein, we present a high-throughput potential alternative for measuring fish acceleration performance using a sprint performance chamber (SPC). The acceleration performance of a large number of juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) from two populations was analyzed. Animals from both hatchery and natural ontogenies were assessed, and animals of known acceleration ability had their ecological performance measured in a mesocosm environment. Individuals from one population also had their acceleration performance assessed by both high-speed cinematography and an SPC. Acceleration performance measured in an SPC was lower than that measured by classical high-speed video techniques. However, short-term repeatability and interindividual variation of acceleration performance were similar between the two techniques, and the SPC recorded higher sprint swimming velocities. Wild fish were quicker to accelerate in an SPC and had significantly greater accelerations than all groups of hatchery-raised fish. Acceleration performance had no significant effect on ecological performance (as assessed through animal growth and survival in the mesocosms). However, it is worth noting that wild animals did survive predation in the mesocosm better than farmed ones. Moreover, the hatchery-originated fish that survived the mesocosm experiment, when no predators were present, displayed significantly increased acceleration performance during their 6 mo in the mesocosm; this performance was found to be inversely proportional to growth rate.},

abstract = {Epilepsy is one of the most common serious neurologic conditions. It is characterized by the tendency to have recurrent seizures, which arise against a backdrop of apparently normal brain activity. At present, clinical diagnosis relies on the following: (1) case history, which can be unreliable; (2) observation of transient abnormal activity during electroencephalography (EEG), which may not be present during clinical evaluation; and (3) if diagnostic uncertainty occurs, undertaking prolonged monitoring in an attempt to observe EEG abnormalities, which is costly. Herein, we describe the discovery and validation of an epilepsy biomarker based on computational analysis of a short segment of resting-state (interictal) EEG. Our method utilizes a computer model of dynamic networks, where the network is inferred from the extent of synchrony between EEG channels (functional networks) and the normalized power spectrum of the clinical data. We optimize model parameters using a leave-one-out classification on a dataset comprising 30 people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and 38 normal controls. Applying this scheme to all 68 subjects we find 100{\%} specificity at 56.7{\%} sensitivity, and 100{\%} sensitivity at 65.8{\%} specificity. We believe this biomarker could readily provide additional support to the diagnostic process.},
